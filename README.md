# <center>Introduction to OCR with Python</center>
### <center>by Dr. W.J.B. Mattingly</center>

## Introduction
Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, is a common task in many domains. The earliest OCR systems were designed to serve the vision impaired. Its modern application, however, has extended to a far wider population. The goal of OCR is to take an input image and output raw text while maintaining the structure of the text in the image. In othere words, its end-goal is to preserve the line breaks, paragraph segmentation, and other features of the structure of the text on the page.

This course is designed to teach you how to automate OCR in Python for optimized results. It is meant to function alongside this YouTube Series [OCR in Python Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2VXyKi-KpYuTAZz__9KVl1jQz74bDG7i)
